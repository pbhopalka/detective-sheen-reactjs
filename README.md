# Detective Sheen

This is a UI problem from Geektrust. The problem statement has been attached as a PDF file in the same repository.

## Problem Statement

Detective Sheen is assigned a task to find falcone. He can go on 4 missions at max. There is a fixed number of
spaceships that can travel some maximum distance. We need to build a UI that will allow Detective Sheen to choose
4 planets that he can go to. Based on the distance of each planets, only those ships which are capable of travelling
that distance should be shown.
